We will practice and have experience with Red hat enterprise linux (Rhel). We will learn about utilities on
Ubuntu and OpenSUSe distributions, the most common Rhel distributions. On main thing about linux, not all
distributions are the same, but the good thing is, once you know linux using one distribution
you need a little practice to be familiar with other distributions because linux distributions are based
on other distributions. The two main groups of distributions are Red hat Based and Debian based.
The diferences usually include packages, names, and their management tools, configuration file names and/or
locations, firewall configuration utilities ,and so on. 

We wil; work mainly with Community enterprise Operating System (CentOS) distribution. It is nearly exact a 
copy of Red hat. It is recommended to update the software packags after installation. We will talk about
super doer (sudo) later.
